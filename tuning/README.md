# cmp-tune — profile tuning

Sets power limit, core/memory VF offsets and the locked core-clock range from
named profiles, per card. Optional; nothing in the unlock depends on it.

`nvidia-smi` cannot set VF offsets, so this talks to NVML directly. It is the
`tune` subcommand of the merged `cmp50hx` binary (`native/`); the `cmp-tune`
command name is an argv[0] symlink. No NVML headers are needed at runtime: the
binary dlopens `libnvidia-ml.so.1`, which the driver already installs.

## Commands

```sh
cmp-tune list                 # profiles in the config file
cmp-tune status               # live state + the ranges the card reports
cmp-tune show efficient       # what a profile would do, without doing it
sudo cmp-tune apply efficient
sudo cmp-tune reset           # back to card defaults

sudo cmp-tune -i 1 apply quiet   # one card only (default: every CMP card)
```

## Profiles

Config is `/etc/cmp-tune.conf` (seeded from `profiles.conf` at install and
never overwritten afterwards). Each section is a profile; every key optional:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `power_w` | power limit, watts |
| `core_offset` | core (GPC) clock VF offset, MHz |
| `mem_offset` | memory clock VF offset, MHz |
| `clock_min` | lower bound of the locked core clock, MHz |
| `clock_max` | upper bound of the locked core clock, MHz |

```ini
[efficient]
power_w = 170
core_offset = 225
mem_offset = 1000
clock_max = 2100
```

## Clock rules

- Set only `clock_max` and the card's **own minimum** supported clock becomes
  the floor. Set only `clock_min` and its maximum becomes the ceiling. So a
  profile never has to hardcode a bound it does not care about, and the lock
  always sits inside the card's real range.
- Set neither and no lock is applied; any existing lock is cleared.
- Every value is validated against what the card reports. On a CMP 50HX that
  is `300..2100 MHz` and `100..225 W`, so:

```
$ cmp-tune show bogus
profile 'bogus' cannot be applied to GPU 0:
  - power_w 500 is outside the card's 100..225 W
  - clock_max 9000 is outside the card's 300..2100 MHz
```

Check the exact numbers for your card with `cmp-tune status`.

## Which GPUs it touches

Only **CMP 50HX** (`10de:1e09`) and **CMP 90HX** (`10de:220d`), matched by PCI
ID. Any other GPU in the box — a display card, another accelerator — is listed
and skipped:

```
skipping GPU 1 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, pci 10de:2204): not a supported CMP card
```

Pointing `-i` at a non-CMP card is refused. With several CMP cards, the default
is to apply to all of them; use `-i` for one.

## Working with the idle governor

The [idle governor](../idle-governor/README.md) and this tool drive the *same*
NVML locked-clock setting, so on its own the governor's release would clear a
tuned clock and let the card boost past it (measured: 2145 MHz after a profile
set 2100, because the VF offset stays live).

`cmp-tune` handles this: when it applies a profile with a clock lock it writes

```
/etc/systemd/system/cmp-idle-governor.service.d/10-cmp-tune.conf
```

with `CMP_LOAD_CLOCK=min,max` (and `CMP_LOAD_CORE_OFFSET` when the profile sets
one) and restarts the governor, so its release restores exactly the profile's
clock and curve. `cmp-tune reset` removes it.

The core offset matters for idle power: a non-zero core VF offset pins the card
in P0 and keeps memory at full clock, so the governor drops the offset while
forcing P8 and puts it back on load. That is worth about 7 W per card compared
with the old P3 workaround. Verified end to end: 2100 MHz under load → P8 idle
→ back to 2100 MHz,
with the power limit and both offsets untouched throughout.

Pass `--no-sync-governor` to leave the drop-in alone.

## Applying a profile at boot

Tuning is runtime state, so after a reboot the card is back at stock and the
governor releases to the stock boost clock rather than your tuned one. To make
a profile stick, name it in the boot-flow policy:

```sh
sudoedit /etc/cmp50hx/boot.conf     # CMP_BOOT_PROFILE=efficient
```

`cmp50hx-boot.service` applies the profile at the end of its boot sequence —
after the PCIe Gen2 phase (the driver is up, so NVML works) and before the
idle governor starts — so the `CMP_LOAD_CLOCK` drop-in is in place when the
governor comes up and it releases to the tuned clock. The apply is
best-effort: a failing profile only logs a `WARN` line to the journal, it
never blocks boot. See the warning below before enabling it.

## Notes and limits

- Auto-apply at boot is **opt-in on purpose**: an unstable overclock that
  re-applies on every boot is awkward to recover from. Validate a profile
  interactively first, and keep in mind that setting `CMP_BOOT_PROFILE=` back
  to empty in `/etc/cmp50hx/boot.conf` plus a reboot always gets you back to
  stock.
- VF offsets shift the whole curve, so the effective clock under load can end
  up above `clock_max` unless a lock is in force. That is why a tuned profile
  should normally set a clock bound too.
- Power limit and memory offset survive an idle-governor clamp/release cycle
  untouched. The core offset is deliberately dropped while idle and restored
  on load, so the card can reach P8 — see the governor's README.
- Values that a profile omits are left exactly as they are — a profile is not
  a full reset. Use `cmp-tune reset` for that, or a profile with no keys
  (`[stock]`).
